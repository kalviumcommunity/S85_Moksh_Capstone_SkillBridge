# SkillBridge – Connect Companies, Students, and Working Professionals to Solve Real-World Problems

## 🎯 Project Idea:
SkillBridge is a full-stack web application designed to connect companies, students, and working professionals to collaborate on real-world problems. It offers a platform for students to gain hands-on experience, for professionals to mentor, and for companies to access fresh talent. The website allows users to create profiles, share project opportunities, and connect with others based on skills, interests, and career goals.

## 💡 Brief Description:
The website enables users to:
- Create profiles (students, professionals, and companies)
- Post and apply for real-world projects
- Connect with others based on skillset, experience, and goals
- Share and showcase past projects and experiences
- Send and receive feedback on work completed
- Login using email/password or social media authentication (Google)
- Access both frontend and backend deployments

The project is part of my capstone submission to demonstrate my end-to-end development skills, including React, Express, MongoDB, REST APIs, authentication, deployment, and more.

## 🗓️ Capstone Day-by-Day Plan (14 Days)
